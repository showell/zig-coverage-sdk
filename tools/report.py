"""**AN SDK.JSONL, JUDGED** the way Antithesis's triage report would: one
verdict per property (src/coverage.zig), over every run whose lines the
file holds. A property is its `id`; its sites are declared (`hit: false`) by
each run, and a run reports the first pass and the first failure of each.

    tools/report.py <sdk.jsonl>

FAIL is a property the runs broke: an Always or AlwaysOrUnreachable seen
false, an Unreachable reached. MISS is one they never got to: a Sometimes
never true, a Reachable or an Always never reached. Antithesis fails both;
this exits 1 on a FAIL only, because a MISS is a gap in the runs, not a bug
(README.md, "Where this differs from Antithesis").
